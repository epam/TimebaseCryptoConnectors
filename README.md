With [TimeBase Community Edition](https://github.com/finos/TimeBase-CE) you get access to free [market data connectors](#supported-crypto-exchanges) you can use to receive normalized market data with any level of granularity (top of the book, L2) from the most popular crypto exchanges and recording it in [TimeBase](https://kb.timebase.info/) **in a matter of minutes**.

## Quick Start - setup market data collection in 60 seconds:

### Prerequisites

**Windows** 

* [Install WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). 
* [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/) on your Windows machine. 

**Linux**

* [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
* [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).  

### Start Connectors 

1. Download sample [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epam/TimebaseCryptoConnectors/main/docs/docker-compose.yml)
2. Run `docker-compose up` command from the directory with your docker-compose.yml file to launch TimeBase crypto connectors. 
3. View live and historical market data stored in [TimeBase](https://kb.timebase.info/community/development/tools/Web%20Admin/admin_guide#stream-actions-monitor) in your browser at [localhost:8099](http://localhost:8099) (default username **admin** and password **admin**):

### Configuration 

By default, we launch with the [default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epam/TimebaseCryptoConnectors/main/java/runner/src/main/resources/application.yaml) configuration to start all the available data connectors. Recorded market data is saved into `/timebase-home` directory. You can create custom configurations to run just the selected connectors with specific settings.

> Refer to the [configuration](https://github.com/epam/TimebaseCryptoConnectors/blob/main/docs/configuration.md) to learn how to configure. 

> Refer to the [developers tutorials](https://github.com/epam/TimebaseCryptoConnectors/blob/main/docs/developer.md) for more in depth information about data model and tutorials on how to develop custom data connectors.
